What is useCallback Hook??

=> useCallback is a Hook that will return memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one
    of the dependencies has changed.

Why useCallback Hook??

=> It is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equlity to prevent
    unnecessary renders.

useCallback vs useMemo

=> useCallback caches the provided function itself while useMemo invokes the provided function and caches its
    result.
